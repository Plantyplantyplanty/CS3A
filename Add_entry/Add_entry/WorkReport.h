    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: -Adding elements one by one
                      -"Resizing" array to twice the size when the amounts of elements equals the capacity
                      -Deleting a given element if it is in the array
                      -"Resizing" the array to 1/2 capacity when it falls below 1/4 the size of capacity.
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free(hopefully). 

    Reflections:
        I wrote this program without debugging the functions one by one, which meant that I spent way too 
        long debugging it. Longer than re-writing the program would have taken. Never did this before,
        never will do it again. It was terrible. However, watching you debug my program did help my 
        debugging skills: I didn't think to comment out the block of code I thought was causing the 
        problem and see what happens. I'll remember that for the future!
