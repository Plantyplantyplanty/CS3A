/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: Initializing, login, and logout. Print was initially created in 
                      2DPointer Library and not moved over(it's called in lab), as per 
                      our discussions.
        -Partly implemented: None
    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free. It does not always link correctly
               after I change something and re-compile, I have to clean it.

    Reflections:
       I feel like the spec for this project changed a lot. It was confusing and I hope
       that I implemented it correctly. Getting logout to work was a struggle when I was
       sick, but much easier when I got better, which put me behind.
