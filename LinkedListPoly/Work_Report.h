/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and boolean operators
                      of terms, term & terms, Polys & terms, Poly & Polys
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        I was not expecting this to be easier than poly arrays, but it was so much easier.
        I think this was also because the dynamic memory was masked beneath layers of 
        previous code.
