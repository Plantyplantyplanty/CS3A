    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: The counter itself, the formatting, and the error state
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
       I liked this project. It seemed fairly straightforward. Hopefully that doesn't mean
       I did it wrong.
