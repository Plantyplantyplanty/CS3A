/*
	Features:
		-Not Implemented:
		-Implemented:
			The palindrom test functionality works perfectly.
		-Partly Implemented:
			the while loop in main does not stop on time
			It was not fixed because I plan never to work in this town.
	Bugs:
		 I think that I have a memory leak because I crash after twenty runs or so...
	Reflections: 
		 Tiptoing through the tulips.
