    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: All functions
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        Most of the iterator functions were used in internal testing. Did not like 
        implementing a queue this way.
