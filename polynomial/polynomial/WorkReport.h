    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None.
        -Implemented: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, comparison, and division
                      of polynomials
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        I foolishly did not do the big three first and had to rehab my program when it became 
        clear that I accidentally shared memory. 
        I implemented division to the best of my understanding. 
        I found showpos's output to be ugly, so I did what you see here.
